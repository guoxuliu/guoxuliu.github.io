About me
======
I am an associate professor in the [School of Computer Engineering](https://cs.wfu.edu.cn) at [Weifang University](http://www.wfu.edu.cn). I received my Ph.D degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering at [Pusan National University](http://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do) in 2020, advised by Prof. Jae Ho Kim. Before that, I received my B.S. Degree in School of Information Science and Engineering from [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn) in 2011 and M.S. Degree in School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in 2014. My current research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with a focus on object detection.
